# SELF DRIVING CAR ENGINEER NANODEGREE UDACITY

Self-driving cars are a transformational technology, on the cutting-edge of robotics, machine learning, and engineering. Autonomous vehicles are here to change the world of automobiles and our day to day transportation systems. Here is a simulation of a mini self driving car using Deep Q learning implemented by me given in this [link](https://github.com/srinjoyganguly/SRINJOY/tree/master/ARTIFICIAL%20INTELLIGENCE/Project%201%20-%20Self%20Driving%20Car%20Simulation). 

## Core Curriculum

### Part 1 - Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

In this term, you'll first become an expert in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. You will teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more all based on just camera data!

Next, you'll learn Sensor Fusion, or how to use an array of sensor data to perceive the environment around the vehicle.

* Project 1 - Finding Lane Lines
* Project 2 - Advanced Lane Finding
* Project 3 - Traffic Sign Classifier
* Project 4 - Behavioral Cloning 
* Project 5 - Extended Kalman Filters

### Part 2 - Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration

In this term, you'll expand on your sensor knowledge to localize and control the vehicle. You'll evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle.

After that, you'll learn how to plan where the vehicle should go, and how the vehicle systems work together to get it there.

* Project 6 - Kidnapped Vehicle
* Project 7 - Highway Driving
* Project 8 - PID Controller
* Project 9 - Programming a Real Self Driving Car
