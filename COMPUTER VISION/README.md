# WELCOME TO THE DOMAIN OF COMPUTER VISION - Giving The Power of Vision To Our AI Species

Computer Vision is one of the cutting edge areas of research today because making vision possible for machines an trying to replicate it similar to that of humans which is a challenging task whereas for humans and animals it's very easy to recognize and interpret many surrounding objects and analyze them accurately. Deep learning plays a very important role to realize the potential of computer vision because deep neural networks are capable of extracting and learning the most difficult pattens, behaviour and data associations in an appropriate manner for any dataset whether it's raw data, images, waveforms or any other information. Computer vision is a very broad field encompassing a wide variety of ways to process images in a manner which might not be so meaningful to the humans, but is meaningful to the machines, for example, data augmentation - images cropped in different locations, standardization of images (making pixel values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1), contrast normalization etc. The main power of computer vision comes from the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which can be made deep if added more than 2 layers and this works wonders in this field. So, mostly for computer vision applications, CNNs are used heavily and their advanced architectures are developed for specialized applications as well.
