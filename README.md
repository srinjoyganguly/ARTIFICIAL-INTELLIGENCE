# WELCOME TO MY GITHUB PAGE !

Here, I will be sharing all of my projects(academic/industry/research) and tutorials related to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Blockchains and VR/AR which I have already done or which I will do in the future from various platforms such as Udemy, Udacity, Coursera, edX or any other job/industry.

Any kind of comments or feedback on my projects are always welcome and I will do my best to make everything look better and informative to everyone who visits my page. I will put my efforts to help anyone I can with my knowledge as well as learning from others about any technology related stuff.

## Structure Of My Github Repo

For the Term 1 of this nanodegree program, out of thousands of applicants, I have achieved the prestigious Udacity-KPIT Autonomous Tech Scholarship 2018/2019 on March 28th, 2019. My batch started from April 15th, 2019. The challenge here is to complete the Term 1 in 2 months rather than normally provided 3 months duartion.

As my work progresses further, more folders will be added. Each folder will consist of the various project folders with their detailed description and from where I have completed that project.

Thank You very much for visiting my page, I am truly grateful to everyone!!!
