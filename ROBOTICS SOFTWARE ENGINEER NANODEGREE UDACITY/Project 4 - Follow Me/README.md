## Future Enhancements

* I have used the Udacity provided data set for my training of the FCN, but more data can be collected and trained to achieve better accuracy.

* Skip connections can also be added to improve our result which will be based on certain number of connections, based on our number of layers we have.

* Adding more layers in our neural network will help our FCN model to capture more underlying features of our data set.
