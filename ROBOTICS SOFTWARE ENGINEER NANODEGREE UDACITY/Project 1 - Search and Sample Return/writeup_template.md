**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**  

**Training / Calibration**  

* Download the simulator and take data in "Training Mode"
* Test out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided
* Add functions to detect obstacles and samples of interest (golden rocks)
* Fill in the `process_image()` function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw images to a map.  The `output_image` you create in this step should demonstrate that your mapping pipeline works.
* Use `moviepy` to process the images in your saved dataset with the `process_image()` function.  Include the video you produce as part of your submission.

**Autonomous Navigation / Mapping**

* Fill in the `perception_step()` function within the `perception.py` script with the appropriate image processing functions to create a map and update `Rover()` data (similar to what you did with `process_image()` in the notebook). 
* Fill in the `decision_step()` function within the `decision.py` script with conditional statements that take into consideration the outputs of the `perception_step()` in deciding how to issue throttle, brake and steering commands. 
* Iterate on your perception and decision function until your rover does a reasonable (need to define metric) job of navigating and mapping.
