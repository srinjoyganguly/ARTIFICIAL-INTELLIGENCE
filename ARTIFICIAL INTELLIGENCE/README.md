## Definition
Artificial Intelligence deals with the study of creation of an intelligence mechanism which can imitate the levels of human intelligence or far beyond that consisting of various capabilities such as logic, rational thinking, reasoning, knowledge, memory, vision and natural language processing.

AI is a very vast domain and it consists of different disciplines for its effective study. Some of the disciplines are as follows - 
* Philosophy
* Psuchology
* Mathematics
* Economics
* Neuroscience
* Computer Science
* Control systems and engineering
* Linguistics

## Brief History Of AI

### 1943 - 1955
In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts showed that any computable function can be calculated using using a network of neurons and propsed a model for an artificial neuron. Donald Hebb in 1949 invented the Hebbian Learning rule and at Harvard, Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds were able to build the first neural network computer in 1950. Alan Turing in a lecture in 1947 introduced the Turing Test, machine learning, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning which were the most influential work in the field of AI and still remains today as cutting edge as was before.

### 1956
John McCarthy in a workshop at Dartmouth proposed the term "Artificial Intelligence"

### 1952 - 1969
Allen Newell and Herbert Simon from Carnegie Mellon University created a General Problem Solver which would imitate human for problem solving tasks. In 1958, McCarthy created the Lisp programming language for AI which remained dominanat for the next 30 years.

### 1966 - 1973
Genetic Algorithms were devised by Friedberg et al., 1959 whhich were based on the fact that small mutations to a machine code can create a good performing program for any particular task. The Backpropagation algorithm was discovered by Bryson and Ho in 1969 which gained a lot of popularity in 1980s for the learning of multilayer perceptron networks.

### 1980 - present
1981 - Japanese announced a plan to build intelligent computers running Prolog programming language for AI. 

### 1986 - present
In this era, the neural networks and it's backpropagation algorithms again gained popularity and many of the things were reinvented again for better computations.

### 1987 - present
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) gained popularity for speech researchers as they were the best mathematical framework to be considered for this kind of research and are generated by training on large real speech data. Data mining becomes a new industry. The Bayesian network, based on probabilistic reasoning was good at uncertain knowledge learning.

### 1995 - present
Artificial General Intellingence was coined by Goertzel and Pennachin in 2007.

### 2001 - present
In this era, we started to notice the availability of large nuber of datasets in every field where AI is involved for example - large number of images of animals, objects, plants, humans, medical data etc, speech data as well as waveforms of medical diagnosis.

## Applications of AI
Now, there are large number of applications of AI in various fields. The most prominent ones are - 
* Robotics
* Speech Recognition
* Game Playing
* Autonomous Systems
* Trading
* Computer Vision
